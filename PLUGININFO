Description="Collect more detailed upload statistics.\n\n⚠ No data previous to enabling this plugin will be available.\n⚠ Some data in the statistics may be hidden to not create an unnecessarily huge page. You can disable this by disabling auto thresholding in the preferences and setting the manual thresholds to 0.\n\n - To open the statistics use the command \"/upstats\".\n - With the command \"/upstats-reset\" you can reset the statistics (it will also create a backup first).\n\nAuthor: https://github.com/Nachtalb\nSource: https://github.com/Nachtalb/more-upload-stats"
