More Upload Statistics
======================

A small plugin for `Nicotine+`_ to create more detailed upload
statistics.

⚠ No data previous to enabling this plugin will be available.

⚠ Some data in the statistics may be hidden to not create an unnecessarily
huge page. You can disable this by disabling auto thresholding in the
preferences and setting the manual thresholds to 0.
